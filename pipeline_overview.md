# Machine Learning Model Creation Pipeline Overview

**Definition of "Machine Learning Model Creation Pipeline"**: everything a person should do, if they are given a problem and pertinent data and they need to return the best model that solves the problem (basically how to approach any [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition).

**Pipeline input**: a kaggle competition (or a problem, a dataset)

**Pipeline output**: the best machine learning model (that solves problem)


## Pipeline Modules: 
1. Understanding the context (in: specific kaggle competition information, out: common sensical/basic understanding of problem and data variables)
   1. Understanding the problem (in: specific kaggle competition problem/data, out: common sensical/basic understanding of problem, or what you are being asked to predct)
   2. Understanding the data (in: specific kaggle competition problem/data, out: common sensical/basic understanding of data variables, or what data you are given)
   3. Understanding the evaluation metric (in: specific kaggle competition evaluation metric, out: common sensical/basic understanding of evaluation metric)
