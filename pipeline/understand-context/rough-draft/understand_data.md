# Understand Data
*final goal: common sensical/basic understanding of data variables, or what data you are given*

## "Understand Data" Notes

Go to "Data" page of the kaggle competition, download all the data files, read all the descriptions of the data files (below the downloads), quote the descriptions of the data files and the data variables and link the page, then open what files you can using pandas.read_csv to see the values of the data variables, finally summarize all the data files and data variables with a set of descriptions (and sample values).
