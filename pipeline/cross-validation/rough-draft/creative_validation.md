# Creative Validation
*goal: define a new process to improve validation or replace it that allows better models to be created*

The question is, could you completely change the validation process and exchange it for one from your own creative creation?

We want models that are not limited by the programmer and are able to learn a wider variety of possible models, as the more it can test, there is a possibility it might reach test a model that has never been seen before can do so much better than standard models trained according to the standard validation process.

Imagine a model that can not only test specific, but it can generate on its own complex processes such as the nodule analysis process which seems to be the most successful. Thus you need to define a process to generate processes. 

informative scoring allows for the model to know where to improve, then it can build more elaborate models based on its poor scoring in a certain category, scoring is elaborately connected to building strong complex models
