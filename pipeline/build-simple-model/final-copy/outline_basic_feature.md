# Basic Feature Outline
*final goal: give a rough description of the features that will be used to build the feature matrix*

## "Basic Feature Outline" Notes
*make an markdown file*

1. Look for the simplest yet effective preprocessing from the kernels section of the competition (that creates a feature matrix that can be used to train a model)
2. Summarize the features that they are using in the kernel (research if you don't know enough)
