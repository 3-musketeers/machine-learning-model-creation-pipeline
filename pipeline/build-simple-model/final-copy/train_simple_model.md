# Train Simple Model
*final goal: use feature matrix to train the simple model (then the trained model can immediatly be used to make predictions)*

## "Train Simple Model" Notes
*make an IPython Notebook*

1. Follow the steps mentioned by the kernel that implements the chosen simple model
2. Create code specific to your folder structure
3. In the end, train a simple model (that could be immediatly used to make predictions)
