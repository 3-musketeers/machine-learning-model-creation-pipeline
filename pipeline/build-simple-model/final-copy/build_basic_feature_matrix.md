# Build Basic Feature Matrix
*final goal: run code to return a matrix contianing all the features for all training examples, ready to train a model*

## "Build Basic Feature Matrix" Notes
*make an IPython Notebook*

1. Follow the basic preprocessing steps mentioned in the kernels from the competition
2. Create code specific to your folder structure
3. In the end, output a feature matrix for the sample dataset (that could immediatly be used to train a model)
