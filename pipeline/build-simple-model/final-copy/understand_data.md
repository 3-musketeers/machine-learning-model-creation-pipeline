# Understand Data +
*final goal: have an even better understanding of data (EDA, preprocessing steps)*

## "Understand Data +" Notes
*make a folder to contain all IPython Notebooks, and notes*

1. Go to kernels section of competition, download the best EDA, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization kernels
2. Rename kernels, put them in the same folder
3. For each kernel:
   1. Open kernel, look at the `import` dependencies of the kernel
   2. Create a markdown cell at the top of the page labeled "**Downloading Instructions**"
   3. Include instructions there for how to download all dependencies
   4. Include any solutions to errors that you faced while downloading
   5. Search up every `import` dependency, find a basic description of the dependency (like what it does)
   6. Create a markdown cell at the top of the page labeled "**Dependency Descriptions**"
   7. Include in the cell the basic descriptions of every dependency
   8. Go cell by cell and understand **what?** (what is being done), **why?** (purpose of specific steps)
      1. For every line of code, explain why it works, how it works, what it does *in line* (only if it is not intuitive)
      2. Add longer concise descriptions if necessary (anything that helps you understand)
   9. Add a markdown cell to the top of the page labeled "**Kernel Summary**"
   10. Include in the cell the summary of what the kernel did
