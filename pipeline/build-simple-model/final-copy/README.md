# "Bulid Simple Model" Module

**input**: specific kaggle competition information, data

**output**: a simple model that creates an actual submission to the competition

## Process:
1. ([understand_data.md](https://github.com/the-machine-learners/machine-learning-model-creation-pipeline/blob/master/pipeline/build-simple-model/final-copy/understand_data.md)) understand the data at a deeper level (EDA, preprocessing steps from others)
2. ([understand_other_kernels](https://github.com/the-machine-learners/machine-learning-model-creation-pipeline/blob/master/pipeline/build-simple-model/final-copy/understand_other_kernels.md)) understand other people's basic models
3. Sketch a simple outline of very basic features
4. ([build_basic_feature_matrix.md](https://github.com/the-machine-learners/machine-learning-model-creation-pipeline/blob/master/pipeline/build-simple-model/final-copy/build_basic_feature_matrix.md)) Extract the basic features from dataset, and build a basic feature matrix
5. Pick a simple model
6. Train simple model using the basic feature matrix
7. Use simple model to make predictions for the test set
8. Create submission formatting function (that takes predictions and generates correctly formatted submission)
9. Submit to public leaderboard
