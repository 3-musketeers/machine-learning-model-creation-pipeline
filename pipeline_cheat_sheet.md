# Pipeline Modules: 
**Pipeline input**: a kaggle competition (or: a problem and a dataset)

1. Understanding the context 
   1. Understanding the problem 
   2. Understanding the data 
   3. Understanding the evaluation metric 
2. Build simple model
3. Build consistent cross validation
4. Look for similar approaches from past competitions
5. Get all domain-specific knowledge
6. Get to know the data
   1. Data Analysis 
   2. Data Visualization
7. Create list of all possible useful models
8. For each model, in "all possible useful models":
   1. preprocess data
   2. feature engineer
   3. feature selection
   4. optimize hyperparameters (on CV)
   5. find final CV/LB score of model
9. Ensembling

**Pipeline output**: the best machine learning model (that solves the problem)
